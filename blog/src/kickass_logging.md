# # KickAss (Java) Logging

> **`Heads up!`** Code samples are in **Awesome** - because it is **Java**.

Long, long time ago, a group of very smart people, [IETF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) decided that *it is not valuable* that developers write their own code for *<strong>ad hoc</strong> latin for <strong>"for this"</strong> project* logging system. So, **syslog** was born - a message logging standard that - *has its own wikipedia page<sup> [[source]](https://goo.gl/fx1x31)</sup>.*

> - **Logging** is an <s>act</s> art of keeping the logfile.

## # Logging is an art ...?

> Logging is an art? Art as in Pablo Picasso, Ludwig Van Bethoven, Edward Irving Ludwig etc. are like a bunch of 0s and 1s throwing messages to a file.

I must say, it's pretty hard to know who's sane these days.

**`TODO`** Logging is an art not because **`...`**

Logging is an art because - **knowing** - *what (activity) and how (level) to log activities* needs some goddamn Picasso skills. Main issue here is, logging affects an application's performance - app's shit the bed when they are run in `DEBUG` mode.
