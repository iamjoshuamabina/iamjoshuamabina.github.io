Long, long time ago, a group of very smart people, [IETF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) decided that *it is not valuable* that developers write their own code for *<strong>ad hoc</strong> latin for <strong>"for this"</strong> project* logging system. So, **syslog** was born - a message logging standard that - *has its own wikipedia page<sup> [[source]](https://goo.gl/fx1x31)</sup>.*

> - **Logfile** keeps records of events happening on your GNU/Linux or else OS. 

> - **Logging** is an <s>act</s> art of keeping the logfile.
