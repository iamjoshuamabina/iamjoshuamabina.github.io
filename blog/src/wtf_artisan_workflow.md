> **`HEADS UP!`** READERS DISCRETION IS ADVISED.

Honestly, I have no fucking clue... So why the fuck bro? *(I hear you ask)*. 
Very *strong coffee* and a very *black urge* to say swear words for no fucking reason.

### # WTF does Artisan even mean?

An **Artisan** - a **skilled craft** man or woman who makes *sexy shit* by hand.

Until **Laravel**, *Artisan* was not a word I would used in a sentence. Fuck that! I still don't... 
It's just a thing I type my in `terminal` when I want *Laravel* to do some cool shit.

### # WTF is Laravel?

> The Laravel framework has experienced exponential growth since it’s initial release in 2011. In 2015 it
became the most starred PHP framework on GitHub and has risen to be the go­to framework for people
all over the world.

> Laravel focuses on you, the end user, first which means its focus is on simplicity, clarity, and getting
work done. People and companies are using it build everything from simple hobby projects all the way to fortune 500 companies.
